-   Please try to be consistent in code formatting, if you use `Prettier`, this are the rules used in all the files:

```json
{
	"arrowParens": "avoid",
	"bracketSpacing": true,
	"endOfLine": "lf",
	"htmlWhitespaceSensitivity": "css",
	"insertPragma": false,
	"jsxBracketSameLine": false,
	"jsxSingleQuote": false,
	"printWidth": 80,
	"proseWrap": "preserve",

-   Function and variable names should be written in snake_case and abbreviated if too long.
-   Use shell commands only if necessary, just to improve `uwufetch` speed.

## Conclusions

I know that adding this file now is a bit late, but I am writing this anyway, just to appear as a _professional_ programmer, even though I am not.

I woult take some space to thank all the [contributors](https://github.com/TheDarkBug/uwufetch/graphs/contributors) that made this project better every day.
